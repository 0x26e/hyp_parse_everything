# hyp_parse_everything
Parser for all Hypixel API stats from the player endpoint.

This project requires API key usage!

This is done via having a file named `API_KEY.json` in the same directory.

The contents of this file should follow the format:

```python
{
    "API_KEY": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" # Insert your API key here
}
```
